Urgent:
Making class for every type of piece which inherits the main Piece class - that way I can remove the long if- statements in Piece class. 
Rewrite the rules of every piece with better more readable code.
Configure the rules so the pawns on the start of the game can move 2 squares ahead.

Ideas:
Add timer for each player.
Display which player turn it is.
Add checkmate.
Display the killed pieces.
